## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Using Xcode
1. Open the `GridNavigationExample` project in the Examples directory
2. The main example app includes all three examples in a tabbed interface
3. Build and run to see all examples in action

### Integrating into Your Project
Each example file is self-contained and can be copied into your project:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import GridNavigation

// Copy any of the example views
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            MovieCatalogExample()  // or PhotoGalleryExample(), ProductCatalogExample()
        }
    }
}
```

## üéì Learning Path

**Beginner**: Start with the basic example in the main README, then explore `MovieCatalogExample` for fundamental concepts.

**Intermediate**: Study `PhotoGalleryExample` to learn about view mode switching and custom layouts.

**Advanced**: Examine `ProductCatalogExample` for complex filtering and professional e-commerce patterns.

## üîß Customization Examples

### Custom Data Models
Each example shows how to implement the `GridNavigable` protocol:

```swift
struct MyItem: GridNavigable {
    let id = UUID()
    let title: String
    let customProperty: String
}
```

### Different Grid Configurations
Examples demonstrate various grid setups:

- **Fixed Columns**: `columnCount: 3, columnWidth: 180`
- **Adaptive Layout**: `minItemWidth: 150, maxItemWidth: 200`
- **Custom Columns**: Using `GridItem` arrays for precise control

### Platform-Specific Features
All examples include:
- **macOS**: Full keyboard navigation with escape key support
- **iOS**: Touch-based navigation with native transitions
- **Cross-platform**: Conditional compilation for platform-specific features

## üì± Platform Support

- **iOS 17.0+**
- **macOS 14.0+**
- **Swift 5.9+**
